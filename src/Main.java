        Q: In computer jargon, what’s the difference between a statement and a comment?
           A: a statement is a step of an algorithm and a comment is a little sticky note you put at the end of your code so you can remember what it does.
        Q: What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
            A: it runs on more than one type of computer.
        Q: In common English, what does the word compile mean?
            A: to put together code in a smaller, compressed, runnable format.
        Q: What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
            A: an executable executes and does stuff, its like a file but instead of opening it, it just runs the code stored in there.

     Ex.2
        Type in the Hello World program; then compile and run it.
        Add a print statement that displays a second message after the Hello, World!. Say something witty like, How are you?. Compile and run the program again.
        Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The new comment should not affect the result.

            ok done lol

    Ex.3
        Remove one of the opening curly braces.
        Remove one of the closing curly braces.
        Instead of main, write mian.
        Remove the word static.
        Remove the word public.
        Remove the word System.
        Replace println with Println.
        Replace println with print.
        Delete one parenthesis.
        Add an extra parenthesis.

        alt shift lets you select multiple lines and type at once, just found that out so i could center all the text at once. cool
